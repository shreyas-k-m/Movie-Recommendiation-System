##Approaches
1. Popularity-Based Recommendation
This approach recommends movies based on their overall popularity. It suggests movies that are highly rated or have been frequently watched by users in the past.

2. Content-Based Recommendation
Content-Based Recommendation suggests movies similar to the ones the user has already liked. It leverages the features of movies, such as genre, director, and actors, to find similar content.

3. Collaborative Filtering Recommendation
Collaborative Filtering Recommendation identifies patterns in user preferences by analyzing the behavior of other users. It recommends movies based on the preferences of users with similar tastes.
